## About the Dataset

### RAIL Lab, KNUST
The dataset from RAIL Lab, KNUST, plays a vital role in addressing the unique challenges of African agriculture. This project is centered on creating an "Afrocentric" dataset, specifically curated to reflect the agricultural diversity and challenges faced in various African regions.

> **The enormous amount of data produced in the context of the fourth industrial revolution frequently does not adequately depict African situations. This disparity leads to a crucial problem: remedies drawn from such datasets frequently turn out to be ineffective when used to address problems unique to African regions. As a result, questions concerning the effectiveness of technologies created without a thorough understanding of the distinctive features of the African landscape are becoming more and more prevalent.**

> **An innovative project has been launched to close this gapâ€”a dataset that is categorically "Afrocentric." This unique dataset is carefully curated, concentrating only on data gathered from the various African areas. This dataset's collection of annotated photos of leaves from diverse crops, showing both healthy specimens and those affected by illnesses, is one of its main components. These pictures show the subtle symptoms of crop diseases at various phases of crop development.**

> **The dataset's emphasis on inclusion, which makes sure that it captures the agricultural diversity found in Africa, is essential to understanding its value. The dataset offers a thorough understanding of disease patterns and manifestations by including annotated pictures of leaves from a range of crops. Researchers, data scientists, and innovators who want to create specialized and efficient solutions for the agricultural problems the African continent faces will find this wealth of knowledge to be of immeasurable use.**

> **This "Afrocentric" dataset essentially serves as a testament to the understanding of the significance of region-specific data in promoting technological solutions that connect with the demands and complexities of Africa. Datasets of this kind open the way for more informed and contextually relevant developments as we navigate the complex convergence of technology and agriculture, ensuring that the advantages of the fourth industrial revolution are realized inclusively across various global landscapes.**

### Plant Village
The Plant Village dataset offers an extensive collection of 70,000 high-quality images, showcasing diseased and healthy plant leaves from nine different species.

> **This dataset consists of 70,000 high-quality images of diseased and healthy plant leaves from 9 different species. Each species has 3 data splits (train, test, and validation), with consistent categories across all splits.**

> **This dataset is ideal for machine learning researchers and practitioners working on plant disease detection and classification, as well as for agricultural experts seeking to improve plant health and crop yields.**

> **The dataset is unique in its diversity, covering a wide range of plant species, diseases, and growth stages. With this dataset, we aim to accelerate research and development in the field of plant pathology and help farmers improve their crop health and productivity.**

        Welcome to the AgriDetect App

    Our Mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any disease in it

    ### Selected Crops
    1. Corn(Maize)
    2. Tomato
    3. Pepper

    ### How It Works

    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our System will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.
    
    ### Note: 
    The app works best when the leaf is taken other than the whole crop branch

    ### Why Choose Us?

    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state of the art machine learning techniques for accurate diseases detection
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive Interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making


    ### Get Started
     Click on the Disease Recognition page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Crop Disease Recognition system
